# ScrambleCraft
ScrambleCraft randomizes the crafting recipe of the item you just crafted. This is a complete rewrite of Minecraft Recipes to allow for recipes to be altered while the game is running. Currently crafting table and furnace recipes can get scrambled.
All vanilla recipes still exist under there respective blocks, this mod simply replaces the recipe to craft those blocks with "Scramble" equivents.

This mod is incompatible with JEI
